              </li>

              <li>
                We collect information when you register, log in, purchase
                services, submit forms, subscribe, or communicate with us.
                Collected data may include your name, email, contact number,
                company details, billing info, and any voluntarily shared
                content. We may also collect analytical data such as IP address,
                browser type, device info, and interaction metrics to improve
                performance.
              </li>

              <li>
                We also gather data related to your project—such as goals,
                design preferences, automation details, and marketing content—
                to deliver customized digital solutions including chatbots,
                websites, automation systems, and campaigns. We do
                <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share personal data without
                explicit consent, except as required for service delivery or
                legal compliance.
              </li>

              <li>
                All payments to

                We use cookies and similar technologies to enhance your browsing
                experience and remember preferences. You can disable cookies in
                your browser, though some features may not function properly as
                a result.
              </li>

              <li>
                Your data is stored securely on servers managed by us or trusted
                providers following strict security standards. We employ
                encryption and administrative safeguards to prevent unauthorized
                access. However, no online system is 100% secure; by using our
                services, you acknowledge this limitation.
              </li>

              <li>
                The Company may share limited data with verified partners and
                vendors only as needed for operations such as hosting,
                analytics, CRM, or integrations (e.g., WhatsApp API, Meta,
                Google). These third parties are contractually obligated to
                maintain confidentiality and lawful data use.
              </li>

              <li>
                We may use your contact details for project updates, system
                alerts, invoices, and promotional content. You can opt out of
                marketing communications anytime, but essential service
                notifications will continue.
              </li>

              <li>
                We retain personal and project data only as long as necessary to
                fulfill contractual or legal purposes, after which it is
                securely deleted or anonymized. Retention aligns with our data
                management policies and statutory obligations.
              </li>

              <li>
                We do not knowingly collect data from individuals under 18 years
                of age. If such data is discovered, it will be promptly removed
